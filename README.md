# Glorious Battleshipx 

# incomplete project
- my apologies for my tardiness in finish my 3rd project in python battleship game on the time period this project was indeed an new challenge I tried planning and didnt go furture more into working into an judgable complete project and learned I needed more practice on playing and using the pythons tools to know how to have an idea to work with and sadly all the referens I found I could never understand the language or reasoning on faults and mistakes which took more times. 

# How to play
- The goal to how to play was by you guess position by rows and colums such as a/rows and number 4/columns in there own order to take an shot agaisnt computer ships.
- the game would be you have an 4x4 board which the computer has 5 random placed ship in the board and you got 12 missiles/attempts/guesses. to find all ships until you out of attempts.
### why 4x4 and why 5 ships with 12 guesses
- The reason simply put would be it would be an quick game I saw many referens and games I tried which for me feelt to long drawn out and lost it fun momentum if I wanted to learn how to play the game that desire would already been fullfilled with 4 missed shot in an 5x5 and 8x8 board grid size.
